\begin{abstract}

In this lab we work with the $3.6 \ m$ dish from Leuschner Observatory,
measuring the $21 \ cm$ line emissions
from atomic hydrogen (HI), an abundant element in our galaxy. Analysing
features of this line, 
we create an image of the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble, by using the total
flux from HI lines to measure the thickness of a Hydrogen column, and
evidenciating the
bubble shell from the center to the edges. 
The methods for tracking, recording and treating the data
are presented and the choices justified. The final result is the image
of Fig.?, made with $\approx 500$ points, mapping the sky from galactic
latitude $-60^{\circ} $ 
to $-10^{\circ} $ ($b = -10^{\circ}  \rightarrow -70^{\circ}$ (JD)), 
and galactig longitude from $160 ^{\circ} $ 
to $220  ^{\circ}$ ($l = 160  ^{\circ} \rightarrow 220 ^{\circ}$ (JD)).

\section{Introduction}

In Radioastronomy, one of the greatest advantages is the hability of
radio antennas on observing the hyperfine energy 
transition of neutral Hydrogen (HI), known as the $21
\ cm$ line, or $1420.4 \ MHz$. This feature is largelly explored due to the fact that this
element is present in the whole universe, and many structuers are comprised of molecular hydrogen.
We explore this fact using the Leuschner dish (Fig.1) to measure the spectra of 
a large scale structure, and identify the HI lines to obtain a direct
measurement of the quantity of this element.

Severall codes were developed, and the steps to
obtain an image of the bubble are presented in this article on the
following steps:

On Section 3 we introduce the physical concepts and some of the
equations underlying the physics of our measurements and data
aquisition.

On Section 4, an overall overview of the developed codes is presented. 
We show the steps from data aquisition untill the data
calibration, before heading to the imaging task.

On the remaining sctions the image is presented and its features
discussed.

\section{The Physics of The Bubble}

The Orion-Eridanus Superbubble is a large cavity inside a huge hydrogen
cloud, formed by stellar winds and the supernovae from Orion OB1
association, a group of several hot giant stars of spectral types O and
B. Its position in the sky, in galactic coordinates, ranges from $-10
^{\circ} to -10^{\circ}$ in galactic latitude $b$, and from $160^{\circ}
to 220^{\circ}$ in galactic longitude $l$. Because the column density of
H atoms of this structure is directly proportional to the intensity of
the $21 \ cm$ line, we use this transition to map the and build an image
of its clouds. The equation used to measure the intensity of the lines
was 

\begin{equation}
N_{H1} = 1.8\times10^{18}\int T_{B}(v)dv \  cm^{-2},
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}  
where $N_{H1}$ is the column density of $H$ atoms, $T_{B}$ is the
brightness temperature of this transition, being a function of the
velocity of the clouds $v$ produced by the Doppler effect. We use the
approximation $ N_{HI} \ approx \sum T_{B}(v) \cdot \Delta v$, where
$\Delta v$ is defined as follows for the $21 \ cm$ line:

\begin{equation}
\Delta = -c\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = 0.31 \ kms^{-1}.
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}  

With that, our task is to collect the spectra of a region in the sky
that contains the Superbubble, integrating at a certain time the signal
from points within a certain range, and also taking noise measurements
to calibrate the data before calculating the column denstity. This work
is described on the next section.

\section{Points in The Sky}

In order to build an image of the region of interest in the sky 
($b = -10^{\circ}  \rightarrow -70^{\circ}$ (JD), $l = 160  ^{\circ}
\rightarrow 220 ^{\circ}$ (JD)), we define the measurement spots with a
$\Delta b = 2^{\circ}$
degrees spacing within the galactic latitude values, giving a total of $30$
points in latitude, and, for the longitudinal measurements, we
define our spacing in terms of the $b$ values as follows:

\begin{equation}
\Delta l = \frac {2^{\circ}}{cos(b)},
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}  
a foreshortening for observers of latitudes different than zero, since
we can go over a full circle by fewer steps (if $b = 0^{\circ}$, no step
is needed!). This will give us different number of longitudinal 
points per latitude value, ranging from around $11$ points for $b = -70 ^{\circ}$
and $30$  $b = -10 ^{\circ}$. The choice of $2 ^{\circ}$ spacing is to achieve a good resolution by
sampling $2$ times per HPBW (Half-Power Beam Width), also known as the
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), which is $\sim 4^{\circ}$ for this dish. About the observation 
time spent at each point, it followed the sequency: $2$ observations of $1 \ min$ and $20 \ sec$ 
to collect information about the HI spectra, and $2$ other observations of $10 \ sec$ to
collect noise measurements in order to calibrate the data. More information about calibration 
is presented on the following sections.

The Orion-Eridanus Superbubble stays visible in our sky (Longitude: $-122^{\circ} 09.4'$ East,
Latitude: $37^{\circ} 55.1'$ North, Leuschner location) from around $11 \ pm$ until $9 \ pm$, when
all our target points set, so our observation schedules respected this window of time, calculateed
by a developed \emph{Python} code. Besides that, our timing had to respect some altitude limits 
above the horizon due to some obstacles as threes and mountains, ilustrated on Fig.2.

Our object in the sky should  be represented by around $694$ points,
but due to timing issues this aimed numbers were revised, and altough this range is displayed
on the images presented on this article, the actual number of samples had to be redefined, and
also the range of observation. To begin with, since we knew where to find the main features of 
the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble, we neglected observations in latitudes in the range $b = -70^{\circ}
\rightarrow -60^{\circ}$, and $b = -12^{\circ} \rightarrow -10^{\circ}$. Also, since we aimed a full cover of 
the structure, we unfortunately had to downsample our observations to $4 ^{\circ}$ spacing on longitude 
values, by skiping each calculated point of observation, and this resulted in a poor resolution image. 
However, the integration time for the spectra aquisition was the same throug all observation and 
remained as previously stated. A scheme of the final checked and unchecked points (and also the skipped ones) 
in our grid is presented by Fig.3. The green dots are representing the points we 
completelly ignored, so we didn't try to collect any information about that region.

the bubble collected in our observation time. As a result, our grid had around $400$ points about
the Orion-Eridanus Superbubble.}

\section{Controlling Leuschner}

The whole data aquisition was made by $Python$ scripts that tracked, set the telescope functions and
saved the data files. A telescope control code worked together with a rotation matrix function,
that changed the \emph{Galactic Coordinates} of our points into \emph{Horizontal Coordinates}, so that the
dish could track, since the telescope function inputs must be \emph{Altitude} and \emph{Azimuth}. The codes and
the math behind it was previously developed for the \emph{Interferometry Lab}, and the details for the
matrices contruction and how they were applied is well described by the article on the following link:
\href{https://github.com/leosattler/ugradio/tree/master/lab_interf}{git hub account, lab\_interf folder}. With the
need of a conversion from Galactic Coordinates, an aditional step was added, making use of the following
matrix provided by the casper website:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}_{(\alpha,\delta)2000\rightarrow(l,b)} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
  -0.054876 & -0.873437 & -0.483835 \\
  0.494109  &  -0.444830 & -0.746982 \\  
  -0.867666 &  -0.198076 & 0.455984
 \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
which is a conversion for the \emph{epoch 2000}. The \emph{PyEphem} and 
\emph{radiolab} module were used to perform some calculations.

In fact the inverse of the previous matrix was used, and the following
matrix operations were applied to get the desired points in the sky:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R}_{(l, b) \rightarrow (az, alt)}=\mathbf{R}_{(ha, \delta) \rightarrow(az, alt)} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{(\alpha, \delta)\rightarrow (ha, \delta)} \cdot \mathbf{R}_{(l,b)\rightarrow(\alpha,\delta)}.
\label{eq:conv}
\end{equation}

For the antenna control, besides these modules, the following ones were used: 
\emph{dish}, \emph{dish\_synth} and \emph{takespec}. The first one was used to perform 
the movements of the telescope, as the tracking and homing, 
just turning the the noise diode of the telescope on and off, for purposes of measuring
the instrumentation noise for data calibration. Only one homing was necessary (in the beginning 
of each observation), and the tracking was made after finding the position in Altitude and
Azimuth, in degrees, for each point of interest. The second one was used to set some
values to the dish, as amplitude and frequency for the Local Oscsilator. The LO (Local Oscilator) frequency 
was $1272.4 \ MHz$, and the amplitude was $10 \ dBm$. The last module
takes the data and save in \emph{.log} files, later written with the module
\emph{readspec\_mod}. At the end of each pointing procedure, we ended up
with $4$ different files later used to perform the calibration, discussed in the next section.
All the codes for tracking and controlling the Leuschner dish can be found 
\href{https://github.com/leosattler/ugradio/tree/master/lab\_dish}{here}.

\section{Data Calibration}

In order to measure the column density by anylising the HI line profiles, we first treat the data
using the $4$ files created for each point. They were the \emph{Noise\_On}, \emph{Noise\_Off}, 
\emph{Spectra\_On} and \emph{Spectra\_Off}, meaning that we took $2$ spectra profiles: one 'On'
our target line, and another 'Off' by $-4 \ MHz$. Together with these $2$ spectra measurements,
we recorded a noise for both instances, hence \emph{Noise\_On} (recording the noise 'On' the
spectra) and \emph{Noise\_Off} (for the case we are off by $4 \ MHz$).

The math to calibrate the data is presented on the handout provided by the Radiolab instructors,
\emph{Calibrating the Intensity and Shape of Spectral Lines}, by Carl Heilies.
Severall steps were performed by using the so called \emph{cool method}. Basically, with all these
measurements, if we plot them on a same figure
we end up with $2$ distinct peaks, and they are off by the value set on the data aquisition 
for the LO ($4 \ MHz$), where the 'On' measurements are around the value of $1420.4 \ MHz$, as expected.
Besides them, we have $2$ spectra of the same profiles but with much higher intensity values. These are 
the noise values, used to calibrate the HI profile by correcting the instrument temperature.
